This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles when specifying the CMD instruction to run a Python application. The original Dockerfile uses "python3 -m http.server 8000" which assumes python3 is in the PATH.  However, this might not always be the case depending on the base image and how Python is installed. The solution demonstrates a more robust approach.
